# Pathfinding Visualization System

## Overview

The pathfinding visualization system has been successfully integrated into your WallManager. It creates colored spheres on board tiles to visualize pathfinding results during wall placement.

## Features

### Visual Indicators
- **Green spheres**: Valid path tiles (tiles that lead to a winning goal)
- **Red spheres**: Inaccessible tiles (no path to goal exists)
- **Magenta spheres**: Last known accessible tiles (were accessible before being blocked)
- **Blue spheres**: Pawn2-specific paths (in BothPawns mode)
- **Cyan blend spheres**: Tiles accessible by both pawns

### Debug Modes
- **Off**: No visualization
- **Pawn1Only**: Show pathfinding only for Pawn 1
- **Pawn2Only**: Show pathfinding only for Pawn 2  
- **BothPawns**: Show pathfinding for both pawns with color blending

## How to Enable

### In WallManager Inspector
1. Find the **"Pathfinding Debug Visualization"** section
2. Enable **"Enable Pathfinding Visualization"** checkbox
3. Set **"Pathfinding Debug Mode"** to desired mode (BothPawns recommended)
4. Enable **"Update Visualization On Wall Placement"** for real-time updates

### Runtime Controls
- **P Key**: Toggle pathfinding visualization on/off
- **O Key**: Cycle through debug modes (Off → Pawn1Only → Pawn2Only → BothPawns → Off)
- **R Key**: Refresh visualization manually
- **1, 2, 3, 0 Keys**: Direct mode selection (Pawn1, Pawn2, Both, Off)

## Testing the System

### Option 1: Use the Tester Script
1. Add `PathfindingVisualizationTester` component to any GameObject in your scene
2. The script will automatically find required components
3. Use the **"Test Pathfinding Visualization"** context menu item
4. Or use the **"Show Available Paths"** context menu for path analysis

### Option 2: Manual Testing
1. Start Play Mode in Unity
2. Press **P** to enable visualization
3. Press **O** to cycle through modes
4. Place walls and observe how pathfinding changes in real-time
5. Press **R** to manually refresh if needed

## Technical Details

### Files Created/Modified
- **`GridPathfindingVisualizer.cs`** (NEW): Core visualization system
- **`WallManager.cs`** (MODIFIED): Integrated visualization controls
- **`PathfindingVisualizationTester.cs`** (NEW): Testing and debugging script

### Integration Points
- Automatically creates spheres on all board tiles during initialization
- Updates visualization whenever walls are placed (if enabled)
- Uses existing GridSystem and GridPathfinder for pathfinding calculations
- Follows your coding standards (no object pooling, pre-allocated spheres)

### Performance Considerations
- Spheres are pre-created and reused (no instantiation during gameplay)
- Real-time updates can be disabled for better performance
- Visualization only active when debug mode is not "Off"
- Colliders removed from spheres to avoid interference

## Usage in Different Scenarios

### During Development
- Enable visualization to debug wall placement logic
- Use BothPawns mode to see strategic implications
- Refresh manually after making code changes

### For Game Balance Testing
- Use single pawn modes to test specific scenarios
- Observe when pawns become completely blocked
- Analyze path efficiency changes with different wall strategies

### For AI Development
- Visualize AI decision-making by enabling before AI moves
- Use path analysis to validate AI pathfinding logic
- Test edge cases where pawns might get trapped

## Troubleshooting

### Spheres Not Appearing
1. Check that **"Enable Pathfinding Visualization"** is checked
2. Ensure debug mode is not set to "Off"
3. Verify WallManager, GridSystem, and GameManager are properly initialized
4. Check console for initialization messages

### Wrong Colors/Visualization
1. Press **R** to refresh manually
2. Check pawn positions are correctly set
3. Verify GridPathfinder is working correctly
4. Use PathfindingVisualizationTester to debug

### Performance Issues
1. Disable **"Enable Real Time Updates"** 
2. Use **"Update Visualization On Wall Placement"** instead
3. Set debug mode to "Off" when not needed
4. Consider reducing sphere count for larger grids

## Console Commands

The system logs helpful information:
- `"Pathfinding visualization enabled/disabled"`
- `"Pathfinding debug mode: [mode]"`
- `"Pathfinding visualization refreshed"`
- Initialization and component status messages

This system provides comprehensive visualization of your pathfinding during wall placement, helping with both development and gameplay understanding.
